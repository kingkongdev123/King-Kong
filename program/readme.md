# KingKong-Game-Contract

A Battle Royal NFT based Smart Contract on Solana

## Program Deployment

- Prepare anchor developmâ™¦ent environments
- Prepare around 9 SOL in the deploy wallet keypair
- Confirm Network cluster in `Anchor.toml` file : f.e. `[programs.devnet]`, `cluster = "devnet"`
- Confirm deploy authority wallet keypair location : f.e. `wallet = "/home/ubuntu/.config/solana/id.json"
- Configure solana cli with deploy authority keypair and deploying cluster : f.e. `solana config set -h`
- Confirm some of the constants for the game in the `/programs/king-kong-game/src/constants.rs` \
`BANANA_TOKEN_MINT_PUBKEY` : banana token mint address <br />
`COLLECTION_ADDRESS` : collection creator address to verify king-kong collection and is used for default game winner<br />
`DAILY_REWARD_DIST_WALLET` : treasury wallet address for distributing daily game reward to king-kong holders around every 00:00 on UTC. auto-distributing is performed on node backend.<br />
must be matched to wallet address on the backend. <br />
`GOLD_CHEST_WALLET` : gold chest wallet address.
- Build program with `anchor build`
- Copy and paste the result deploy scripts from Build terminal message : f.e. `solana program deploy /home/ubuntu/solana/king-kong-game/king-kong-game/target/deploy/king_kong_game.so`

### To Change Program Address

- Delete the program keypair in `/target/deploy/king_kong_game-keypair.json`
- Build project with `anchor build`. This will generate new keypair
- Get the address of new keypair with `solana address --keypair ./target/deploy/king_kong_game-keypair.json`
- Change program addresses in project code. `Anchor.toml`, `/programs/king-kong-game/src/lib.rs`
- Build program object again with `anchor build`
- Deploy newly built so file with `solana program deploy`

## Initialize and Operatie with Smart Contract
These functions are in the `./lib/scripts.ts` file<br />

)
```

## Notes for FE Integration

For the FE side web3 integration, the scripts in `lib` directory except `scripts.ts` file can be used without no change.
The only thing the FE dev should change is providing `web3 connection` & the `anchor program` object from idl.
Should configure properly in `BROWSER` environment.
